# Motif Based Approach

## Overview
The motif based approach compares windows from a locus of a genome, or randomly selected windows from the entire genome to a given enhancer sequence in order to determine with locus window sequence most likely correlates to that enhancer based on motif content.

The following scripts may be ran in order: Kmer_dist -> Kmer_visualizer -> Kmer_bed -> Kmer_comparison
